         "celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. The rate we choose included a "
         'poolside cabana, which was visually nice but not very practical. The '
         'pool cabanas are located by the lower pool, which does not have any '
         'sun after noon. It would have been much nicer to have been up at the '
         "Adult's only pool, which is not under the shadow of the building. "
         'Honestly, I would not recommend renting a pool "Oasis" cabana to '
         "anyone because of it's location and poor service. Allow me to "
         'elaborate.   On our first day, we arrived before our room was ready '
         'so we headed down to the cabana, which I had reserved in advance. We '
         'were not greeted when we arrived to the pool area and I had to look '
         'for someone to show us to our cabana. The gentleman that showed us '
         'to our cabana proceeded to bring us iced water, a plate of fruit and '
         'a menu. We did not see him or any other pool attendants again for '
         'about an hour as the cabanas are in a secluded area behind the pool. '
         'We would have liked to order some food and drinks much sooner than '
         'we did. And to my dismay, once we ordered our drinks we did not '
         'receive them for a long time. I also ordered the Corvina Ceviche. '
         'The ceviche was okay, but it was room temperature and may have given '
         'me a stomach virus, because I was vomiting that evening.   Luckily, '
         'our experience improved later in the evening. After we returned from '
         'dinner, we were greeted by a hand written note, a bottle of Malbec, '
         "and some chocolates in honor of my boyfriend's birthday. That was a "
         'wonderful touch!   The next day, the pool service was a little '
         'better in our cabana as we were given bottled water and a larger '
         'assortment of fresh fruit. Although, we did not spend much time in '
         'the cabana as we decided to go down to the beach. The beach '
         'attendants greeted us instantly and set up chairs for us, but we '
         'were not offered bar service the remainder of our time on the '
         'beach.   We decided to sit down for lunch at Fresco and sadly had '
         'another bad experience. I had to stand up and ask someone to serve '
         'us. The menu options were very limited. I chose the fish tacos, '
         'which were very bland and dissatisfying. My boyfriend ordered the '
         'quesadilla, which he also found mediocre. The only compliment we '
         'have was for the chocolate mousse.   Besides the pool staff, I would '
         'like to commend the decor and the rest of the hotel staff. Our room '
         'was beautiful. The large balcony and lounge chairs were wonderful to '
         'enjoy the ocean view. The girls at the check-in desk were very '
         'polite and the valet and bell-hops always welcomed us with kind '
         'words and smiles. It was lovely to find that the valet left two '
         'bottles of water in our cup holders when we departed.   We ordered '
         'in-room dining twice and both occasions were terrific. We ordered '
         'the Brioche French Toast around midnight and when they quoted us 30 '
         'minutes, we were surprised to here our doorbell ringing only 10 '
         'minutes later. Before checking out, we had breakfast delivered to '
         'the room and the attendant, Leticia, was very kind. She was very '
         'quiet and considerate as I was still in bed, while my boyfriend '
         'opened the door for her. She also returned to remove the trays '
         'quickly. Our overall experience was very relaxing, minus the minor '
         'hiccups at the pool and my stomach virus. Even with the hefty price '

         'set of slippers and left 1 chocolate, 1 bottle of water and 1 '
         'glass..... There were 2 of us registered in the room. We shared the '
         "chocolate.... Guess we didn't need the calories anyway.   I had "
         'asked for a late check out which was granted with a nice letter '
         'addressed to MR. P..... No mister in our girls retreat. Or on my '
         'Starwood account.   The room was clean at first glance but there '

         "Check in was a little crazy. The hotel didn't seem overly crowded, "
         'but I think many families asked for a late checkout and the cleaning '
         "staff couldn't clean the rooms fast enough to get people checking in "
         'their rooms by 4pm. When we checked in we were greeted warmly, '
         'offered champagne, and they gave my daughter a bag of St. Regis '
         'beach toys. She was so excited that all she wanted to do was go to '
         'the beach! We headed to the beach and were told the room would be '
         "ready shortly. Long story short the room wasn't ready until nearly "
         '6pm and I felt obligated to continue to ask the front desk staff '
         'what was happening rather than someone coming to me with updates. I '
         'was once offered a similar room on a lower floor, but I thought this '
         'was unacceptable. Fortunately, Ashley at the beach took great care '
         'of us. She put my family in a cabana so my daughter could dry off '
         '(our clothes were still with the concierge) and brought a laundry '
         'bag for our dry clothes. She checked on our room, brought the keys '
         'to us when the room was finally ready, and escorted us to the room. '
         'She and other members of the beach staff (Robert and David) sent a '
         'letter of apology to our room with a tray of cookies, chocolate, and '
         "champagne. The check-in experience wasn't even their fault! I can't "
         'say enough about how appreciative me and my family were for their '
         'hospitality that afternoon and the rest of the week.   The '

         "frantically from the airport because we had left my daughter's "

         'let me know he found the passport. He without hesitation told me '

         'there...nothing made us feel that "extra special for our '

         'Room"...when we got inside our room (1210) the "view" was on the '
         'resort/hotel next to us and a partial ocean view. It seemed that the '
         'room was pushed to the side of the Resort. Anyways we did not say '
         'anything because we had already settled in and did not want to go '
         'through the hassle.  -We wanted to go out and have dinner, we asked '
         'valet to bring out our car...the guy (maybe a new hire) had no idea '
         'what /or where our car was...he came out 3 times asking the details '
         'of our car like it was no where to be found. After a little while he '
         'brought it out and we went our way.  -Mid-Night comes around and I '

         'WAS ALSO EXPIRED! At this point I was skeptical and scared. -Woke up '
         'the next morning(Birthday), and found a HUGE nasty stain on the '
         'comforter (which I took a picture of); we did not see it earlier '
         'because it was neatly tucked under the mattress (smart). No '
         'breakfast in our system yet because we wanted to get the comforter '
         'changed. Called front desk and told them the issue (exactly). 10 min '
         'later house keeping comes (W/O a comforter!) so I explain that we '
         'need nothing else except the change of the comforter. She calls '
         'another staff to bring a comforter and he comes (5 min later) with a '
         'new one......and guess what even that had a stain on it :( so he ran '
         'out to grab another one. We inspect it carefully and then it was '
         'changed.  So this "special day" was starting off on the wrong foot; '
         'We had to cancel our breakfast reservation and go to an early lunch '
         'instead during an awkward time.  -We returned to the Resort and '

         'area and was greeted by lovely staff and was seated. When he arrived '
         'with covers and towels (to my horror....the stains returned). We '
         "asked them to be changed right away. We couldn't go to the beach due "
         'to high tides; so we decided to stay by the pool. Ordered food and '
         'drinks from FRESCO (loved it).  The rest of the day went as '
         'expected. -After returning from our dinner late night ; we were '
         'unable to enter our room. Super exhausted, we call front desk and '
         'were advised that security will be on their way asap. No one showed '
         'up for a while, so we call again...this time waited on the phone '

 'text': '  My husband and I just returned from a perfect 4 day visit to the '
         'resort. Property - the property is exquisite. Both the interior and '
         'the exterior are beautifully decorated. The designers have managed '
         'to create an atmosphere that is consistently elegant, serene, warm, '
         'and modern without being stuffy or cold. Service - I have no idea '
         'from where Starwood recruits and how they train the staff at this '
         'resort, but from reception to the valets to the pool and beach staff '
         'to the butlers - every single individual was articulate, highly '
         'professional, customer focused, and matched the tone and atmosphere '
         "of the resort, right down to the St. Regis logo'ed socks worn by the "
         'beach staff! But more importantly than socks, each member of the '
         'staff was responsive, warm, and professional. We twice borrowed '
         'bicycles, which were promptly delivered, adjusted for fit along with '
         'recommendations on the best places for riding. We spent most of our '
         'outdoor time at the Tranquility Pool and on the beach, where the '
         'staff expertly set us up with lots of shade, extra towels, and '
         'bottled water delivered in ice filled buckets. Staff stopped by our '
         'chairs to see if we needed refills etc often enough that we noticed '
         'but not so often that it became annoying. And the little things, '
         'like using the word "Absolutely" and addressing us by name, made a '
         'subtle but enormous difference in our perception of the service. '
         'Yes, we noticed... Food - we ate all but one meal on the property. '
         'J&G Grill was superb. As our server one evening stated, "If you are '
         'willing to be a little adventurous..." We went with each of his '
         'recommendations and were wowed by both the presentation and taste of '
         'the food. I\'ve seen some reviews of the "value" of the meals, and '
         'sure, it is expensive, but no more so than at other 5 star resorts '
         'or in Manhattan, Hawaii, LA, Vegas, etc. And we ordered from the '
         'Miami Spice menu at our second visit to J&G at the behest of our '
         'server the first night - there was NO difference in the service '
         'based on how we ordered. Rooms - I can only say that our room(s), '
         'the first a junior suite on the 18th floor then an Imperial Suite on '
         'the 24th floor, were exquisite. We were moved as there was noisy '
         'construction on the patios below our first room on the lower floor. '
         'But the manager promptly moved us with apologies for our '
         'inconvenience. Each room was immaculate, richly appointed, fully '
         'stocked, and made us feel like royalty. Even outside on the '
         'balconies, the floors and furnishings were immaculate. I mean not a '
         'spec of dirt or dust or rain water marks or bird stuff - at an '
         'oceanfront resort! My only complaint is that at night, we could not '
         'get the room cold enough for a truly excellent sleep. We set the '
         'thermostat at 65, but the room never got colder than about 70. But '
         'this was minor, and actually consistent with a lot of hotels who use '
         'motion detectors to turn off the AC when the room appears to be '
         "empty. I'm not sure if this is the case here, but it was the only "
         'issue with our stay. This is truly a world class resort in every '

         'well-appointed, relaxing space.   We brought our daughter to the '
         'pool each day, and she loved it. The family-friendly pool is clean, '
         'safe and has the same exceptional service as the adults-only pool. '

         'Sushi Lounge and La Gourmandise (the pastry/coffee restaurant in the '
         'lobby). All the food in each restaurant was very good. I especially '
         'enjoyed the sushi and the chocolate eclairs.   We also enjoyed '
         'viewing the champagne sabering ceremony in the lobby bar (at 7:30 PM '
         'each evening). Afterwards, everyone in the bar enjoys a '
         'complimentary glass of champagne.    Another perk of this resort is '
         'its close proximity to the Bal Harbour Shops. We visited the shops '
         'several times, and ate at some of the restaurants there, including '
         'Carpaccio, Le Zoo and Makoto. The shops are a quick two-minute walk '

         "Tiffany's, Rolex, Panerai, Tod's, Prada, Ferragamo, La Perla, "
